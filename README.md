# Background

In this project, you'll be conducting web scraping and data analysis related to Mars. You'll utilize your skills in identifying HTML elements, extracting information using both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup, and scraping various types of information such as HTML tables and recurring elements from webpages.

As you progress through this challenge, remember that you're strengthening essential skills in collecting, organizing, storing, analyzing data, and communicating insights visually.

# What You're Creating

This assignment consists of two main technical deliverables:

**Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News**
- Open the Jupyter Notebook named `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`.
- Utilize automated browsing to visit the Mars news site and scrape relevant information.
- Extract titles and preview text of news articles, storing the scraping results in Python data structures.
- Optionally, store the scraped data in a JSON file.

**Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data**
- Open the Jupyter Notebook named `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`.
- Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site and scrape relevant information.
- Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame and analyze it.
- Answer questions related to the dataset, such as the number of months on Mars, the number of Martian days worth of data, the coldest and warmest months on Mars, etc.
- Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
